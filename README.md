# Welcome to the RookieHPC website repository! :D #
To newcomers, a short introduction: the RookieHPC website covers major technologies in High-Performance Computing (HPC), providing documentation along with examples, as well as exercises and sometimes tools.

The website you see online (at [rookiehpc.com](https://rookiehpc.com) or [rookiehpc.github.io](https://rookiehpc.github.io) indifferently) is generated automatically from this repository through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). In other words, not only can you see and access 100% of this website's source code, but you can also participate and contribute to its improvement since you have all Github tools at your disposal! :D
