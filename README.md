# Welcome to the RookieHPC website v2! :D #
To newcomers, a quick introduction: the RookieHPC website covers major technologies in High-Performance Computing (HPC), providing documentation accompanied with examples, as well as exercises and sometimes tools.

## Why a version 2? ##

For reference:
- Current RookieHPC website (a.k.a v1): https://www.rookiehpc.com
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) version of RookieHPC website (a.k.a v2): https://rookiehpc.github.io (work in progress)

Although the two websites are visually identical, the v2 is much better at accommodating contribution and collaboration since it has access to the full panel of tools from Github. A quick comparison:

|Current RookieHPC website version | RookieHPC website v2
|-|-
|<ul><li>[Contact form](https://rookiehpc.com/contact.php)</li></ul>|<ul><li>[Github issues](https://github.com/rookiehpc/rookiehpc.github.io/issues)</li><li>[Wiki](https://github.com/rookiehpc/rookiehpc.github.io/wiki)</li><li>[Pull requests](https://github.com/rookiehpc/rookiehpc.github.io/pulls)</li><li>[Projects](https://github.com/rookiehpc/rookiehpc.github.io/projects?type=beta)</li><li>[Milestones](https://github.com/rookiehpc/rookiehpc.github.io/milestones)</li></ul>

At the time of writing, the content is still being ported from the current RookieHPC website to its version 2. When this will be complete, the URL https://www.rookiehpc.com will point to the Github Pages version in a seamless transition. Only a single version of the website will remain, no more v1/v2 distinction :)
