    "Description": "The function omp_set_num_threads is one of the three ways to specify the number of threads to use when creating parallel regions. The other two are the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS and the num_threads clause. The function omp_set_num_threads specifies, during execution, the number of threads to use from now when creating parallel regions. It overwrites, for upcoming parallel regions only, the value that the environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS defined. It can be overwritten, for a specific parallel region only, by the num_threads clause. If none of the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, the function omp_set_num_threads or the num_threads clause is used, the number of threads used when creating parallel regions is implementation defined. To see the number of threads used when creating a parallel region, one can call omp_get_num_threads inside the parallel region created.",
