    "Description": "shared is the clause that contains the variables shared across the threads belonging to the OpenMP parallel region concerned. Such variables are therefore accessed concurrently, arising potential data-races. It is the responsibility of the user to protect shared variables with synchronisation mechanisms, if needed. The other possible data-sharing policies are private, firstprivate, lastprivate and linear.",
