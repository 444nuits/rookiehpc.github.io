OpenMP proposes a different approach; decorating your code with directives. The advantage being you can write your code thinking serially, then parallelise it incrementally without having to rewrite your code or know about low-level parallelism concerns.</p><p>Having been a key player in HPC for the last 20 years and continuously improved in the meantime, no need to say that the performance of OpenMP is quite competitive.</p>"}]}
