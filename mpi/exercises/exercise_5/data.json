    "Introduction":"A classic collective: the reduction. This exercise consists in writing an application where each process declares a variable containing a value equal to its MPI rank times 100. Then, all processes participate to a collective operation calculating the sum of all these variables and store the sum in a variable held on MPI process 0, which then prints it.",
