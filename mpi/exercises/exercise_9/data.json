    "Introduction":"This application is made of 3 MPI processes: MPI process 0 holds a 2D array that contains an even number of consecutive integers starting from 0. You must write a program that scatters this array, with a collective operation, such that MPI process 0 receives nothing, MPI process 1 receives all odd numbers and MPI process 2 all even ones.",
