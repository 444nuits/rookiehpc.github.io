    "Description":"MPI_Reduce_scatter is the means by which MPI processes can apply a reduction followed by a variable scatter, which may trigger extra optimisations compared to manually issuing an MPI_Reduce followed by an MPI_Scatterv. Unlike MPI_Reduce_scatter_block, MPI_Reduce_scatter allows blocks to be of different lengths. MPI_Reduce_scatter is a collective operation; it must be called by every MPI process in the communicator given. Predefined operations are: MPI_MIN, MPI_MAX, MPI_BOR, MPI_BXOR, MPI_LOR, MPI_LXOR, MPI_BAND, MPI_LAND, MPI_SUM and MPI_PROD. Other variants of MPI_Reduce_scatter are MPI_Reduce_scatter_block, MPI_Ireduce_scatter_block, MPI_Ireduce_scatter. Refer to MPI_Ireduce_scatter to see the non-blocking counterpart of MPI_Reduce_scatter.",
