    "Description":"The MPI_IN_PLACE is an option used in MPI routines that involve both a send and a receive phase, such as MPI_Gather and its variants. By passing MPI_IN_PLACE as the send buffer, the MPI routine knows that the send and receive buffer are one same buffer.\nNote: the in-place variant of MPI_Sendrecv does not rely on MPI_IN_PLACE but is a distinct routine MPI_Sendrecv_replace.",
