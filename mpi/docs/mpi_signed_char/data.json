    "Description":"MPI_SIGNED_CHAR is an MPI_Datatype that represents a signed character type in MPI, it corresponds to a signed char in C. The difference with MPI_CHAR is that the latter is treated as the printable character, while MPI_SIGNED_CHAR is treated as the integral value. This is why MPI_CHAR cannot be used in reduction operations for instance while MPI_SIGNED_CHAR can.",
