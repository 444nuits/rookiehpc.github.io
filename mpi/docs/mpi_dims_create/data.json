    "Description":"MPI_Dims_create is a convenience function in the creation of cartesian topologies (MPI_Cart_create). This routine decomposes a given number of processes over a cartesian grid made of the number of dimensions specified. MPI attempts to balance the distribution by minimising the difference in the number of processes assigned to each dimension. The programmer can restrict the number of process to allocate to any dimension. If MPI is not able to find a decomposition while respecting the restrictions given, the routine returns an erroneous value. Otherwise, the decomposition found is stored in the array passed.",
