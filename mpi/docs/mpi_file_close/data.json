    "Description":"MPI_File_close closes the file associated with the file handle passed, deallocates the file handle and sets it to MPI_FILE_NULL. Before closing, MPI_File_close synchronises the file state (equivalent to performing an MPI_File_sync). Also, MPI_File_close deletes the file once closed if MPI_MODE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE was passed to the corresponding MPI_File_open. MPI_File_close is a collective operation, it must be called by all MPI processes in the communicator concerned.",
