    "Description":"MPI_Cancel marks a pending non-blocking operation (send or receive) for cancellation and immediately returns. The underlying communication may or may not have already taken place by the time MPI_Cancel was issued. If the call to MPI_Cancel took place before the underlying communication actually happened; the communication is successfully cancelled and no message is sent or received. In the case of a buffered send such as MPI_Ibsend, the corresponding send buffer is automatically freed, and in the case of a receive such as MPI_Irecv, the reception buffer is not altered. However, if the call to MPI_Cancel happened after the underlying communication already took place, the message was already sent or received. Either way, the call to MPI_Cancel is local therefore the non-blocking operation must still be passed to MPI_Wait (or its derivatives), MPI_Test (or its derivatives) or MPI_Request_free. Refer to MPI_Test_cancelled to determine whether a non-blocking operation effectively completed or was cancelled by MPI_Cancel.",
