    "Description": "MPI_Comm_create allows MPI processes from a given communicator to create communicators: one per communicator group specified.\nA communicator is built upon a group of processes, which can be split into subgroups (disjoint or overlapping). When calling MPI_Comm_create, each MPI process from that communicator must specify one of these subgroups. Any subgroup specified must be specified by all MPI processes in that subgroup. Paired with the fact that each MPI process can specify only one subgroup when calling MPI_Comm_create, if different MPI processes specify different subgroups, these subgroups must be disjoint (otherwise an MPI process belonging to more than one of these subgroups would be required to specify all of them while being able to specify only one).\nIf a given MPI process is not part of the subgroup it specifies, such as MPI_GROUP_EMPTY, MPI_COMM_NULL is obtained as the new communicator instead. Otherwise, it will obtain a new communicator containing all MPI processes from the subgroup specified. MPI_Comm_create is a collective operation, it must be called by all MPI processes from the original communicator.",
