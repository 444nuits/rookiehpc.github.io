In C the MPI_Status is a structure that contains at least 3 attributes: MPI_SOURCE, MPI_TAG and MPI_ERROR. There may be additional attributes that are implementation-specific. When the user has no use of the MPI_Status, they can pass the constant MPI_STATUS_IGNORE (or MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE for array of statuses).\nIn Fortran-90, the MPI status is represented with MPI_STATUS_SIZE."
