    "Description":"MPI_PROC_NULL is a constant that represents a dummy MPI process rank. When passing it to a send or receive operation for instance, it is guaranteed to succeed and return as soon as possible. MPI_PROC_NULL has, but is not limited to, two main uses;\n- acting as a placeholder in MPI routines where an argument of type out must be set to the rank of an MPI process, such as in MPI_Cart_shift for instance.\n- conveniently coping with boundaries; rather than preventing MPI processes on edges from issuing sends or receives for instance, MPI_PROC_NULL will be used instead to turn these invocations into dummy calls. Effectively, this allows all MPI processes to issue the same calls regardless of their position.",
