    "Description":"MPI_MODE_EXCL is a flag that can be passed to MPI_File_open in conjunction with the flag MPI_MODE_CREATE. MPI_MODE_EXCL specifies that if the file created already exists, an error is raised. In other words, MPI_MODE_EXCL ensures that the file opened was not existing already and therefore was created during the MPI_File_open issued.\nOther tags are: MPI_MODE_RDONLY, MPI_MODE_RDWR, MPI_MODE_WRONLY, MPI_MODE_CREATE, MPI_MODE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE, MPI_MODE_UNIQUE_OPEN, MPI_MODE_SEQUENTIAL and MPI_MODE_APPEND.",
