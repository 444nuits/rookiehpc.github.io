    "Description": "MPI_Cart_shift virtually moves the cartesian topology of a communicator (created with MPI_Cart_create) in the dimension specified. It permits to find the two processes that would respectively reach, and be reached by, the calling process with that shift. Shifting a cartesian topology by 1 unit (the displacement) in a dimension therefore allows a process to find its neighbours in that dimension. In case no such neighbour exists, virtually located outside the boundaries of a non periodic dimension for instance, MPI_PROC_NULL is given instead.",
