The fact that the majority of MPI routines still rely on \"int\" count arguments is due to backward compatibility reasons.\n- MPI_COUNT is an MPI_Datatype used to inform MPI about the type of a variable passed to a routine. Similar to MPI_INT being the MPI_Datatype corresponding to an int, MPI_COUNT is the MPI_Datatype corresponding to an MPI_Count. Please refer to MPI_COUNT_KIND to see the FORTRAN equivalent."
